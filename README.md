For this project, I implemented a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to play a game of checkers, without requiring mandatory jumps. The algorithm evaluates potential moves through simulation, expansion, and backpropagation to identify optimal strategies. The game logic handles player and computer moves, checkers-specific rules like king promotions, and heuristic evaluations of board states. This project was completed after watching lectures on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and a final simulation of one possible board position demonstrated that the algorithm effectively
